now can convert series
notice that the folder you want to convert must follow this rules:
1. contains ONLY the images you want to convert
2. or contains ONLY the folder which is a part of the serie
3. or contains ONLY PDF files which is also a part of the serie
for instance, let say, we have 3 folders ONESHOT,SERIES and pdfSeries then
ONESHOT only contains file .jpg or .png
SERIES only contains folders part01 part02, which follow the concept of ONESHOT
pdfSeries only contains PDF files part01 part02
part01 and part02 is just a name, you can name whaterver you want, but their lexicographic order should be the same as your order
i have also provide an extra small tool unzipfile.sh
it can extract all the zips in the folder which contains unzipfile.sh
